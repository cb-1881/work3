CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/magic/Desktop/work3/vmmul-omp-harness-instructional/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /global/homes/c/cbrausen/work3/vmmul-omp-harness-instructional/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/magic/Desktop/work3/vmmul-omp-harness-instructional/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/global/homes/c/cbrausen/work3/vmmul-omp-harness-instructional/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
